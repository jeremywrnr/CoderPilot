    <h2> welcome to code pilot!</h2>
    <p> This is a tool meant to help people collaborate on code more seamlessly.
    The model is based on that of a pilot and a co-pilot, where the pilot does
    most of the actual programming, and the co-pilot performs background coding
    tasks. This can include version control management, system testing, online
    reference lookup, and commenting/documenting source code.</p>
