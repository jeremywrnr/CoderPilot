## NOTES / ERRORS

if try to edit file contents while renaming, many errors - go back to not
renaming on the rename form losing focus. a teacher can have lecture code
stored in the repo, and then walk through bit by bit (eg commits), even if not
runnable in the browser/cloud form controls must share editor template, or will
break sometimes after longtime of unwatching: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected
token Y

- conflict with sharejs and docs??? renaming to files
- probably something to do with using autopublish
- ESPECIALLY AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL!!!!
- teacher/pilot vs student/copilot

### done
