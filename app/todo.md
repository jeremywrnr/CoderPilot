## NOTES / ERRORS

a teacher can have lecture code stored in the repo, and then walk through
bit by bit (eg commits), even if not runnable in the browser/cloud
form controls must share editor template, or will break
sometimes after longtime of unwatching:
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token Y

- conflict with sharejs and docs??? renaming to files
- probably something to do with using autopublish
- ESPECIALLY AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL!!!!
- teacher/pilot vs student/copilot

### done

<!--
have a link to rename or edit the project files...
make login info pop to the left | align it right
deleting and renaming button (NOW DOES) work
remove autopublish, p/s specific datasets
have partially curved border, lower ace
make prompt to open new file on close
color rename/delete buttons on hover
squash preforked git history
make the chat list nicer
-->
