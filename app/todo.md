TODOS
=====

## UI

removing login with email option, just github
tabbed user interface

## GITHUB API

testing out pushing to an existing repo
loading a repos content, commit history
creating an issue on this repo

## TESTING

doing some testing with the code - js, render?
or maybe python tutor lol??? but could be cool

## LOGIC

remove autopublish and publish and subscribe to specific user datasets
deleting and renaming button not working...
assigning different templates to different roles

- teacher/pilot
- student/copilot
- ESPECIALLY AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL!!!!

ability to snapshot, or fork code, and test!
ability to pull a repo, and walk through commits, so a teacher can have lecture
code stored in the repo, and then walk through bit by bit, even if it is not
yet runnable n the browser or cloud or whatever - very hands on stuff!

### more notes, errors

so the editor has to be in the same template as the form controls or they wont
have a link to rename or edit the project files...
ALSO the ace-editor is being super buggy :( .. not sure why
spometimes: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token Y
- probably something to do with using autopublish
- conflict with sharejs and docs??? renaming to files

### done

<!--
make the chat list nicer
make login info pop to the left | align it right...
squash preforked git history
-->
