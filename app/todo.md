madeye.io
meteor testing manual
velocity - testing solution

EDITING GITHUB PERMISSION REQUESTS:
testing out pushing to an existing repo
loading a repos content, commit history
ability to snapshot/fork code
walk through commits (too much like desktop apps?)
make tasks have a message - no null
creating an issue on this repo - could be helpful to PROF
activity feed along with the chat
diff/commit on the user

## UI / UX

add more labels on right side of task input
coloring login button based on copilot
attach links for refenece to file issue
make show / hide (hide completed) button
a distributed task - 1 pilot, 4 copilots
making the task items more usable
change template based on roles
copilot - write veiw of tests
pilot - read view of tests
video or talk embedding
copilot doesnt edit code
better testing interface
gutter indicators:
    copilot comments
    recent edits

## NOTES / ERRORS

collab github education? - snapshot code: save to github, notes section - load
specific files for a specific group id??? - look into how to write meteor
tests, starting doing so please if try to edit file contents while renaming,
many errors - go back to not renaming on the rename form losing focus. a
teacher can have lecture code stored in the repo, and then walk through bit by
bit (eg commits), even if not runnable in the browser/cloud form controls must
share editor template, or will break sometimes after longtime of unwatching:
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token Y

- conflict with sharejs and docs??? renaming to files
- probably something to do with using autopublish
- ESPECIALLY AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL!!!!
- teacher/pilot vs student/copilot
