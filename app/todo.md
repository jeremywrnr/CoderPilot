madeye.io meteor // testing manual velocity // testing solution

hardcode three files
start syntax highlighting
reconfigure public only repos
structure of repo - make one for each user, have user request to collaborate on
another users repo, make a

copilot is tkaing snapshots of the code while testing - save files under the
test, so testing does not disrupt  the editing. branching for testing, and then
when passing tyhe tests do a merge from mater in the testing app

testing / checkin / issues

## GITHUB API (online)

EDITING GITHUB PERMISSION REQUESTS:
testing out pushing to an existing repo
loading a repos content, commit history
ability to snapshot/fork code
walk through commits (too much like desktop apps?)
make tasks have a message - no null
creating an issue on this repo - could be helpful to PROF
activity feed along with the chat
diff/commit on the user

## UI / UX

bug - clicking on box doesnt disable it??
add more labels on right side of task input
coloring login button based on copilot
attach links for refenece to file issue
make show / hide (hide completed) button
a distributed task - 1 pilot, 4 copilots
copilot - write veiw of tests
pilot - read view of tests
copilot doesnt edit code
actual testing interface
gutter indicators:
    copilot comments
    recent edits

## NOTES / ERRORS

video or talk embedding - collab github education? - snapshot code: save to
github, notes section - load ESPECIALLY AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL!!!! -
teacher/pilot vs student/copilot specific files for a specific group id??? -
look into how to write meteor tests, starting doing so please if try to edit
file contents while renaming, many errors - go back to not renaming on the
rename form losing focus. a teacher can have lecture code stored in the repo,
and then walk through bit by bit (eg commits), even if not runnable in the
browser/cloud form controls must share editor template, or will break sometimes
after longtime of unwatching: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token Y

### done

<!--
change template based on roles
making the task items more usable
conflict with sharejs and docs??? renaming to files
probably something to do with using autopublish
removing login with email (just github)
have a link to rename or edit the project files...
looking at roles, changing editing profiles
make login info pop to the left | align it right
deleting and renaming button (NOW DOES) work
chat: only show initials for briefness?
github integration
make message box look nicer
remove autopublish, p/s specific datasets
have partially curved border, lower ace
make prompt to open new file on close
color rename/delete buttons on hover
if no files yet, say clicknew in list
squash preforked git history
make the chat list nicer
insert a better glyph for the current file
make settings panel info boex success?
tabbed user interface - elseif in meteor?
or rather how to do some routing in meteor
clicking on a file should go to edit tab
just make rename field focus a function
when make a newfile, autofocus rename
autofocus namefield on rename
clean up css duplication rules
option to pick roles
basic roles management
