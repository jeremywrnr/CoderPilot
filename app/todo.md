## GITHUB API (online)

EDITING GITHUB PERMISSION REQUESTS:
testing out pushing to an existing repo
loading a repos content, commit history
ability to snapshot/fork code
walk through commits (too much like desktop apps?)
make tasks have a message - no null
creating an issue on this repo - could be helpful to PROF
activity feed along with the chat
diff/commit on the user

## UI / UX

a distributed task - 1 pilot, 4 copilots
gutter indicator, where they wre editing recently
chat: only show initials for briefness?
change template based on roles
make message box look nicer
pilot - read view of tests
copilot - write veiw of tests
video or talk embedding
copilot doesnt edit code, better testing interface

## NOTES / ERRORS

collab github education?
snapshot code: save to github, notes section
load specific files for a specific group id???
look into how to write meteor tests, starting doing so please
if try to edit file contents while renaming, many errors - go back to not
renaming on the rename form losing focus. a teacher can have lecture code
stored in the repo, and then walk through bit by bit (eg commits), even if not
runnable in the browser/cloud form controls must share editor template, or will
break sometimes after longtime of unwatching: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected
token Y

- conflict with sharejs and docs??? renaming to files
- probably something to do with using autopublish
- ESPECIALLY AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL!!!!
- teacher/pilot vs student/copilot
