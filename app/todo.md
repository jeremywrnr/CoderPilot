TODOS
=====

## UI

removing login with email (just github)
move filerename under fileitem, d load.
change template based on roles
tabbed user interface
option to pick roles

## GITHUB API (online)

testing out pushing to an existing repo
loading a repos content, commit history
walk through commits (like desktop apps)
creating an issue on this repo
    - could be helpful to PROF
ability to snapshot/fork code

## NOTES / ERRORS

a teacher can have lecture code stored in the repo, and then walk through
bit by bit (eg commits), even if not runnable in the browser/cloud
form controls must share editor template, or will break
sometimes after longtime of unwatching:
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token Y

- conflict with sharejs and docs??? renaming to files
- probably something to do with using autopublish
- ESPECIALLY AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL!!!!
- teacher/pilot vs student/copilot

### done

<!--
have a link to rename or edit the project files...
make login info pop to the left | align it right
deleting and renaming button (NOW DOES) work
remove autopublish, p/s specific datasets
squash preforked git history
make the chat list nicer
-->
