TODOS

## GITHUB API (online)

making a new repo
branching for testing
loading content from a repo into files, then docs
ability to snapshot/fork code
walk through commits (too much like desktop apps?)
make tasks have a message - no null
creating an issue on this repo - could be helpful to PROF
activity feed along with the chat
copilot is taking snapshots of the code while testing
save files under the test, so testing does not disrupt  the editing
passing the tests do a merge from mater in the testing app
writing to the contents of a sharejs document


## UI / UX

gutter indicators: copilot comments, recent edits
add more labels on right side of task input
attach links for reference to file issue
a distributed task - 1 pilot, 4 copilots
actual testing interface
copilot doesnt edit code
copilot - write view of tests
pilot - read view of tests


## NOTES / ERRORS

video or talk embedding - collab github education? - snapshot code: save to
github, notes section - load ESPECIALLY AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL!!!! -
teacher/pilot vs student/copilot specific files for a specific group id??? -
look into how to write meteor tests, starting doing so please if try to edit
file contents while renaming, many errors - go back to not renaming on the
rename form losing focus. a teacher can have lecture code stored in the repo,
and then walk through bit by bit (eg commits), even if not runnable in the
browser/cloud form controls must share editor template, or will break sometimes
after longtime of unwatching: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token Y start
syntax highlighting structure of repo - make one for each user, have user
request to collaborate on another users repo, make a - Let the pair switch off
whenever they want if one person is getting tired or stuck or wants a chill
break to be hanging out more passively in the background maybe include and
automated metric on how 'in flow' the person is, and hardcode three files
suggest a change if it drops below a certain point - testing / checkin / issues
madeye.io meteor // testing manual velocity // testing solution - also case
study from Mythical Man Month of surgeon + multiple assistants model of
programming.


### done

<!--
hardcode three files
make show / hide (hide completed) button
bug - clicking on box doesnt disable it??
EDITING GITHUB PERMISSION REQUESTS:
testing out pushing to an existing repo
loading a repos content, commit history
reconfigure public only repos
change template based on roles
making the task items more usable
conflict with sharejs and docs??? renaming to files
probably something to do with using autopublish
removing login with email (just github)
have a link to rename or edit the project files...
looking at roles, changing editing profiles
make login info pop to the left | align it right
deleting and renaming button (NOW DOES) work
chat: only show initials for briefness?
github integration
make message box look nicer
remove autopublish, p/s specific datasets
have partially curved border, lower ace
make prompt to open new file on close
color rename/delete buttons on hover
if no files yet, say clicknew in list
squash preforked git history
make the chat list nicer
insert a better glyph for the current file
make settings panel info boex success?
tabbed user interface - elseif in meteor?
or rather how to do some routing in meteor
clicking on a file should go to edit tab
