<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> This is a tool meant to help
people collaborate on code more seamlessly, featuring the ability to import
repos from GitHub, edit them simulatenously as your collaborators, and
finally commit back to GitHub. It also serves as a bridge for people learning to
use version control. This project started out as the master's thesis of <a
target="_blank" class="alert-link" href="https://jeremywrnr.com"> Jeremy
Warner</a>, and is open sourced (<a class="alert-link" target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/jeremywrnr/git-sync">see on GitHub</a>) with the <a

  <p> This is a tool meant to help people collaborate on code more seamlessly.
  The model is based on that of a pilot and a co-pilot, where the pilot does
  most of the actual programming, and the co-pilot performs background coding
  tasks. This can include version control management, system testing, online
  reference lookup, and commenting/documenting source code.</p>
